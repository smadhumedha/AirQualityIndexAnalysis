# Air Quality Index Analysis

<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>This project aims to analyze air quality data for Delhi during January 2023 to gain insights into the Air Quality Index (AQI) and pollutant concentrations. The analysis involves calculating AQI, categorizing air quality, exploring temporal trends, identifying correlations between pollutants, and comparing AQI metrics with recommended air quality standards.</p>

<h2>About the Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset contains air quality measurements for Delhi during January 2023. It includes 9 columns and 562 records, comprising:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Date and time of measurement</li>
  <li>Concentrations of various air pollutants such as Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitric Oxide (NO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10), and Ammonia (NH3) in µg/m³.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Concepts Used in the Project</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Air Quality Index (AQI):</strong> AQI is a numerical scale used to represent the quality of air in a specific location. It categorizes air quality into different levels ranging from "Good" to "Hazardous," considering various pollutants.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Techniques such as data cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation are employed to analyze the dataset effectively.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Visualizations including time series plots, bar charts, pie charts, and correlation matrices are utilized to represent and interpret the data.</li>
  <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> Statistical methods are used to calculate AQI, identify trends, and analyze correlations between pollutants.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Interpretation:</strong> The analysis aims to interpret the data to understand the prevailing air quality conditions, identify pollution patterns, and assess the severity of air pollution in Delhi during January 2023.</li>
</ul>
